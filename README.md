# TermUI

TermUI is the pure Go UI toolkit used for most if not all of TerminalWars's built in programs. The reason this needs to exist is because all the toolkits that don't use the GPU (which TerminalWars's MaltaOS cannot utilize without massive changes that are out of the devs' scope) are unmaintained or barely maintained, but this one will be about as maintained as TerminalWars is.

There's a basic example of how to use this in [/examples/basic.go](https://github.com/Terminal-Wars/TermUI/blob/master/examples/basic.go).
