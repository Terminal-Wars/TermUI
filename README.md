# TermUI

TermUI is the pure Go UI toolkit used for most if not all of TerminalWars's built in programs, because fuck it, GTK sucks to use with Golang and all the other GUI toolkits mainly use the GPU so fuck it I'll make a goddamn GUI toolkit myself.

There's a basic example of how to use this in [/examples/basic.go](https://github.com/Terminal-Wars/TermUI/blob/master/examples/basic.go).
