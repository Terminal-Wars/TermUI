# TermUI

TermUI is the pure Go UI toolkit used for most if not all of TerminalWars's built in programs. ~~The reason this needs to exist is because all the toolkits that don't use the GPU (which TerminalWars's MaltaOS cannot utilize without massive changes that are out of the devs' scope) are unmaintained or barely maintained, but this one will be about as maintained as TerminalWars is.~~ Actually MaltaOS is now based on modern Linux, meaning this is now obsolete. This is only here for extreme cases (one program) where interfacing with raw X11 is helpful.

There's a basic example of how to use this in [/examples/basic.go](https://github.com/Terminal-Wars/TermUI/blob/master/examples/basic.go).
